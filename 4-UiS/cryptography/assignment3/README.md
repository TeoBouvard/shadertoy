# Getting started

```shell
make tests
make demo
```

Note : A basic graphical visualization of the chain has been implemented. In order for it to display properly, you should run the above commands in a terminal more than 100 characters wide. If the terminal is narrower than this value, the output is going to look really messy.

# Directory structure

```shell
├── makefile
├── README.pdf
├── report.pdf
└── src
    ├── blockchain.py
    ├── demo.py
    └── hash.py


1 directory, 6 files
```
